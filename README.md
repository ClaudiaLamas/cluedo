Welcome to Cluedo Game, inpired in the well known board Game Cluedo and Mindera Bootcamp "Criminals", "Places" and "Weapons".


## MindSwap Game
The game features a deck of 15 cards, divided into 3 categories: Locations, Criminals, and Weapons. The game will randomly place 3 cards, one from each category, hidden inside an envelope. The remaining 12 cards will be distributed randomly among the 2 players. And so begins the first round.

## Start
Compile the server and run it;
Compile the playerClient and run it 2 times;
Enjoy the game ;)

## How to play:
In the first round, on your turn, you must place a bet with each type of cards. On your turn, all the cards you don't know yet appear. The opponent has to answer you by showing one of his cards (if he has any of those included in your bet) or, if he doesn't have any to show you, he answers "no".

## Round:
At each round you can place a bet or a final bet. But the final bet, you only can place it after the 1st round. The opponent, must answer you showing you a card. 
It's the same for each player to proceed to the next round.
